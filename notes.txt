# modified main & scripts in package.json -> run in terminal -> npm run dev
# For instant changes - 
add this -> node --watch backend/server.js in the package.json->scripts->dev
and now run -> npm run dev
or 
install nodemon i.e npm install nodemon -D
update package.json->scripts->dev -> nodemon backend/server.js
Now run -> npm run dev
